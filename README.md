# JavaScript-Coding-Challenges

<p align="justify">
  This repository contains a collection of JavaScript coding challenges that I will use to prepare for technical interviews and coding tests. Each challenge is designed to test my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, as well as my problem-solving and coding skills.

## Module 1: Fundamentals (1_FUNDAMENTALS)

<p align="justify">
  In this folder, you will find challenges that cover the fundamental concepts of JavaScript. The provided HTML files make it easier to tackle the challenges by applying the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with page elements. This helps me enhance my knowledge of manipulating HTML elements using pure JavaScript (vanilla).

## Module 2: Functions (2_FUNCTIONS)

<p align="justify">
In this folder, I am practicing the implementation of functions in JavaScript without the use of HTML. Here, my focus is on improving my ability to write efficient and reusable functions by calling them directly in the script. This practice allows me to solidify my understanding of function syntax, scope, parameters, and return values.
